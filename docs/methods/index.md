# Methods Overview

This section documents the **conceptual structure, interpretive logic, governance posture, and explicit limits** of the Public Diplomacy Simulation Lab (PDSL).

PDSL is a **deterministic, theory-constrained simulation framework** designed for controlled scenario reasoning in public diplomacy contexts. It is not a forecasting system and does not support empirical causal inference or operational decision-making.

The documents below are organized to support **academic review, policy analysis, and methodological transparency**, while maintaining a strict separation from the simulation engine and its implementation.

## Core documents

### Model Card
Defines purpose, intended use, non-claims, assumptions, and high-level inputs/outputs.

### Methods Note
Provides a **public-citable methods narrative** describing outcome channels, regime-based interpretation, and governance posture—without exposing engine mechanics.

### Review Protocol
Specifies documentation-only review expectations and guardrails for interpreting outputs.

### Governance
Describes disclosure boundaries, version discipline, and separation between academic/review and private/commercial tracks.

### Limitations
Enumerates explicit constraints and non-claims to prevent misuse or over-interpretation.
