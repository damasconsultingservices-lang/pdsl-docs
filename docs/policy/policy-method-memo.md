## Executive Summary

The **Public Diplomacy Simulation Lab (PDSL)** is a deterministic analytical framework designed to support **structured reasoning about algorithmic influence** in public diplomacy contexts. PDSL does not forecast outcomes, automate decisions, or generate policy recommendations. Instead, it provides a **governed analytical environment** for interpreting how exposure, identity alignment, and threat framing interact under modeled conditions. Its purpose is to enable disciplined scenario reasoning, policy education, and methodological clarity in digitally mediated influence environments.

## What PDSL Does

PDSL is designed to:

- Support **scenario reasoning**, not prediction  
- Enforce **interpretive discipline** through regime-based analysis  
- Separate **short-run persuasion dynamics** from **long-run identity alignment**  

Outputs are intended to be read comparatively and contextually, not as standalone scores or empirical estimates.

---

## What PDSL Does *Not* Do

PDSL explicitly does not:

- Perform causal inference  
- Generate policy recommendations  
- Support operational deployment  
- Enable personalization, targeting, or optimization  

The framework is analytical and educational in orientation, not prescriptive or automated.

---

## Why Regimes Matter

Regime-based interpretation ensures that analytical outputs are read **in context**. Rather than assigning invariant meaning to raw values, PDSL interprets results through analytically defined regimes that constrain allowable narratives and policy interpretations. This approach reduces the risk of overreaction to marginal score changes and helps distinguish between escalation, stabilization, and diminishing-return conditions.

## Governance and Safeguards

PDSL adopts a **governance-first posture** designed to preserve internal coherence and interpretive consistency. Outputs associated with PDSL v0.1.1-review-ready should be understood as **deterministic, auditable “what-if” signals** generated under explicitly stated assumptions. Results that fail to meet documented coherence standards are treated as non-reviewable.

## Appropriate Uses

PDSL is appropriate for:

- Policy education and training  
- Analytical skill development  
- Conceptual stress-testing of narratives  
- Academic and methodological research  

---

## Inappropriate Uses

PDSL should not be used for:

- Decision automation  
- Forecasting public opinion or behavior  
- Targeted influence or persuasion campaigns
