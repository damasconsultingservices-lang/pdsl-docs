# Public Diplomacy Simulation Lab (PDSL)
## Public, review-facing documentation

**Release anchor:** v0.1.1-review-ready  
**Author / Owner:** Frantz Damas  

Public diplomacy now operates inside **algorithmically governed environments**—systems that curate visibility, prioritize affect, and shape attention at scale. PDSL is a **deterministic, theory-constrained simulation framework** built to support **controlled scenario reasoning** and **regime-based interpretation** in these environments.

PDSL is **not** a forecasting system and does **not** perform causal inference. It is a governance-first analytical artifact designed for reviewability, interpretability, and disciplined use.
