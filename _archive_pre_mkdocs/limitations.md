# Limitations & Non-Claims

PDSL public documentation is designed to prevent overclaiming. Accordingly:

## PDSL Does Not Provide
- causal estimates of algorithmic influence
- predictive forecasts of individual or population behavior
- platform-specific reverse engineering or proprietary signal modeling
- individualized targeting, profiling, or manipulation capability

## Interpretation Constraint
Outputs must be treated as comparative constructs under explicit assumptions, not real-world measurements.
