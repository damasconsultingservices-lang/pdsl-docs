# PDSL Review Protocol (Public)

## Review Goal
This review evaluates whether the public documentation for PDSL is coherent, transparent, ethically bounded, and interpretable—without requiring access to the private engine.

## Reviewer Checklist (Conceptual)
1. **Scope clarity:** Is PDSL’s intended use stated without overclaiming?
2. **Non-claims:** Are causal/predictive claims explicitly excluded?
3. **Interpretability:** Is it clear that outputs require regime-based interpretation?
4. **Disclosure boundary:** Is sensitive implementation detail intentionally excluded?
5. **Governance discipline:** Are versioning and citation expectations explicit?
6. **Ethics:** Are misuse risks acknowledged and mitigations stated?

## Review Outputs
Reviewers may provide:
- suggested clarifications in language or structure
- requests for additional conceptual transparency
- concerns about misuse potential or disclosure boundaries

## What Reviewers Should Not Expect Here
- engine source code
- equations or parameter thresholds
- operational testing endpoints
- deployment instructions

This is a documentation review release.
