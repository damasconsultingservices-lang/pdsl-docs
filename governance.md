# Governance & Disclosure Boundary

## Disclosure Boundary
PDSL public documentation is designed to support reviewability and responsible interpretation while preventing misuse. Therefore, this repository intentionally excludes:
- engine source code and executable logic
- equations, parameter thresholds, and tuning rules
- operational validation scripts and deployment details

Public materials describe **meaning, assumptions, and interpretive discipline**—not implementation mechanics.

## Versioning
Public releases are anchored to explicit tags (e.g., `v0.1.1-review-ready`). Review artifacts should cite the tagged release, not untagged commits.

## Authorship & Ownership
PDSL is authored and governed by **Frantz Damas**.
