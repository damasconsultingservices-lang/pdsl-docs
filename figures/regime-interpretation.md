# Regime Interpretation Guide (Public)

## Principle
APR, IAS, and PST are not standalone empirical measures. They are interpretive constructs whose meaning depends on a regime-based analytical framework.

## How to Read Outputs
- Treat outputs as **comparative signals** across scenarios, not predictions.
- Look for **directional change** under controlled input variation.
- Use sensitivity notes to understand which conceptual inputs most influence outcomes.
- Respect the non-claims: no causal inference, no forecasting.

## Why Regimes
Regime interpretation provides disciplined meaning under theory constraints: it reduces the risk of over-reading outputs and supports transparent communication to reviewers and policy audiences.
