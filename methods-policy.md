# Methods Overview (Policy-Facing)

PDSL is a deterministic simulation framework that supports controlled scenario reasoning in public diplomacy contexts. It transforms abstract, analyst-defined inputs (e.g., exposure, framing intensity with saturation, identity salience, AI literacy, time) into three governed outcome channels: APR, IAS, and PST.

The framework is theory-constrained and interprets outputs through a regime-based lens. This approach emphasizes transparency of assumptions and disciplined interpretation rather than predictive accuracy. PDSL is intended to help analysts compare scenarios, stress-test narratives, and understand how governance thresholds may shape policy support dynamics under stated constraints.

PDSL does not produce empirical causal estimates or forecasts and should not be used to infer real-world behavioral effects.
