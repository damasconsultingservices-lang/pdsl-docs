# Dissertation-Ready Figure Callouts (Public)

**Public Diplomacy Simulation Lab (PDSL)**  
**Release anchor:** v0.1.1-review-ready

This file contains ready-to-paste figure callout paragraphs for dissertation chapters (typically Chapters 4–5) and working paper results sections. Language is reviewer-safe (non-causal; non-predictive) and explicitly version-anchored. All interpretations respect the public disclosure boundary and do not rely on engine-level implementation details.

## Callout 1 — Regime-Based Interpretation (Primary)

As shown in *Figure X.Y — Regime-Based Interpretation of Policy Support (PDSL v0.1.1-review-ready)*, PDSL does not treat **Policy Support via Threat Framing (PST)** as a standalone scalar that carries invariant meaning across conditions. Instead, PST is interpreted through a **regime-based analytical framework** that accounts for framing saturation, relative responsiveness between distribution and framing, and diminishing-returns constraints. This regime-based lens matters because identical or similar PST values can correspond to distinct policy-relevant states (e.g., escalation, plateau, or diminishing-return conditions), thereby constraining interpretation and reducing the risk of over-reading marginal score changes.

## Callout 2 — Governance and Reviewability (Methods-to-Results Bridge)

PDSL’s interpretive claims are governed by an explicit **review and governance discipline** designed to ensure internal coherence and interpretive consistency. Outputs associated with PDSL v0.1.1-review-ready are therefore best read as **deterministic, auditable “what-if” signals** generated under clearly stated assumptions. Figures derived from this framework should be interpreted as structured comparative reasoning tools, not as empirical forecasts or causal estimates of population-level effects.

## Callout 3 — Policy Implication Framing (Results Interpretation)

Within the PDSL framework, policy implications are expressed as **regime-contingent guidance** rather than universal prescriptions. For example, a framing-dominant regime indicates that narrative intensity functions as the marginal accelerator of policy support in the short run, whereas a saturated plateau regime signals diminishing returns to further framing and elevates alternative governance levers—such as distribution strategy or resilience-building—as higher-yield interventions. These regime shifts formalize when escalation is analytically warranted, when maintenance is sufficient, and when further escalation becomes cost-ineffective due to saturation dynamics.
