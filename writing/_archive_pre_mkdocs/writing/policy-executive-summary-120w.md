**Public Diplomacy Simulation Lab (PDSL)**  
**Release anchor:** v0.1.1-review-ready

Public Diplomacy Simulation Lab (PDSL) v0.1.1-review-ready is a **deterministic, governance-first simulation framework** for controlled scenario reasoning in public diplomacy—not for causal inference or forecasting. It maps structured analytical inputs (exposure, threat framing with saturation, identity salience, AI literacy, and time) to three governed outcome channels: **Algorithmic Persuasion Risk (APR)**, **Identity Alignment Shift (IAS)**, and **Policy Support via Threat Framing (PST)**. PST is interpreted through **regime-based classifications** that account for saturation dynamics and relative responsiveness between distribution and framing, such that similar scores may imply escalation, plateau, or diminishing returns. PDSL is best used to compare policy levers, stress-test narratives, and identify governance thresholds under explicitly stated assumptions and limits.
